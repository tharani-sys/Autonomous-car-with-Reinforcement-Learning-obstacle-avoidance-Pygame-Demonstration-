# Autonomous-car-with-Reinforcement-Learning-obstacle-avoidance-Pygame-Demonstration-
A 2D autonomous car simulation using Pygame and OpenCV. The car navigates obstacles automatically with three sensors, a real-time reward system, and a live dashboard. Frames are recorded as output.avi. Serves as a base for future reinforcement learning experiments.
